# personal-site-frontend
This site is my teaching and portfolio platform. It provides structured lecture notes in PDF form, a searchable archive of solved programming problems, and showcases my CV and contact details. Built with Angular and Spring Boot for scalability, it blends learning resources with my professional profile.
